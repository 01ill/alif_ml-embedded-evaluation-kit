## Use case APIs

The directories in here are individual CMake projects to generate use case API static libraries. These libraries are 
intended to be used by external projects that only want access to the ready-to-use ML use case pipelines implemented in this repository.
This can be as CMake projects, but also in the form of CMSIS-packs. These libraries do not depend on the HAL layer and
are platform-agnostic to allow for easy portability.
